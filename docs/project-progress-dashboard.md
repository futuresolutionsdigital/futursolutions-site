## How To Read This Dashboard

**Status legend**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Done | Complete and verified; no further work needed for launch |
| 🟡 In progress | Substantially built; specific gaps remain (listed) |
| 🔴 Not started | Required but no meaningful work done yet |
| ⏸️ Deferred | Intentionally postponed (post-launch / future phase) |

**Benchmark scoring (1–5)** — applied to both master and sub-projects so progress is comparable over time:

| Score | Bar |
|---|---|
| 5 | Flagship: nothing meaningful left; would ship to a paying client today |
| 4 | Strong: minor polish only |
| 3 | Solid skeleton: real gaps that affect quality or conversion |
| 2 | Partial: significant structural or operational gaps |
| 1 | Absent / non-functional |

**Benchmark dimensions** (the goals you asked to gauge against):
1. **Strategic alignment** — matches positioning & offer architecture in `strategy-reference.md`
2. **Visual design** — premium, consistent, on-token, differentiated
3. **Content structure** — depth, IA, scannability, "products not pages"
4. **Operational readiness** — forms, CRM-ready fields, booking/lead capture wiring
5. **Legal / compliance** — privacy, terms, scoped healthcare language, disclaimers
6. **SEO readiness** — titles, meta, canonical, sitemap, schema, alt text
7. **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.2 AA: contrast, targets, focus, skip links, semantics

## Part 1 — Master Project (FutureSolutions Parent Site)

**One-line status:** Strategically, visually, and structurally strong; **content, SEO, trust, and identity infrastructure in place** and **restructured for conversion** (trimmed redundancy, single primary CTA, unified service URLs, transparent pricing). Remaining gap to launch is **integrations only** (GHL lead delivery, analytics, prod env vars).

**Overall launch readiness: ~90%** (all non-integration polish + conversion restructure complete). Homepage trimmed 11→8 sections; `/seo`→`/services/local-visibility` and `/backend`→`/services/growth-systems` (with redirects); all 5 service pages + service detail pages now use one shared `FinalCTA`; "from $" pricing anchors added; Resources roadmap removed; thank-you page slimmed; header leads with a single audit CTA. Remaining gap is **integration + prod env** — not design, content, structure, or trust.

### Master scorecard

| Dimension | Score | State | What closes the gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic alignment | 5/5 | ✅ | Done — transparent "from $" pricing anchors + audit-first single primary CTA + trimmed redundancy |
| Visual design | 4.7/5 | ✅ | Contrast/readability tuned, crisper borders + card lift, brighter dark sections; optional: real photography/mockups |
| Content structure | 5/5 | ✅ | Done — About, 5 industry pages, 3 published articles, FAQs everywhere + homepage FAQ |
| Operational readiness | 3.5/5 | 🟡 | Form submits w/ validation + honeypot; **GHL/email delivery deferred** |
| Legal / compliance | 4.5/5 | ✅ | Real entity (Future Solutions Digital LLC) + CA jurisdiction; optional counsel review |
| SEO readiness | 4.5/5 | ✅ | robots, sitemap, canonicals, OG image, Twitter cards, JSON-LD (+ Org legalName/address/contactPoint) |
| Trust / identity | 4.5/5 | ✅ | Contact page, footer contact block, brand favicon, studio identity, consistent SLA |
| Accessibility | 4/5 | 🟡 | Strong; full WCAG 2.2 sweep of new routes recommended |

- **Industries** hub + 5 detail pages (`/industries/[slug]`: med spas, solo, wellness/functional, hormone/TRT, associations) tied to live demos + nav entry
- **Resources**: 3 published articles + `resources/[slug]` route + roadmap reframed as "what's coming next"
- **SEO infra**: robots.txt, `@astrojs/sitemap`, production canonicals, OG image (`/og/default.svg`), Twitter cards, JSON-LD (Organization, WebSite, Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, Article)
- **Custom branded 404** + async font loading + favicon reference fix
- Legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`) + footer links; functional audit form (validation + honeypot)

## Part 2 — Sub-Projects (Template / Demo Systems)

Five Foundation systems. Each is both a **live demo (proof asset)** and a **sellable website system**. The **Association** system just completed a full flagship polish and is now the **reference standard** the others should be measured against.

### Sub-project portfolio at a glance

| # | System | Brand (fictional) | Slug | Pages | Detail page | Maturity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Professional Association | Meridian Health Professionals Assoc. (MHPA) | `association` | ~22 | `/templates/association` | ✅ Flagship |
| 2 | Premium Wellness Clinic | Lumen Health House | `premium-wellness-clinic` | ~14 | `/templates/premium-wellness-clinic` | 🟡 Strong |
| 3 | Solo Practice | Aster Private Health | `solo-practice` | ~10 | `/templates/solo-practice` | 🟡 Strong |
| 4 | Med Spa | (Med Spa Website System) | `med-spa` | ~9 | `/templates/med-spa` | 🟡 Strong |
| 5 | Men's Health / TRT | VANTAGE Men's Health | `hormone-trt` | ~8 | `/templates/hormone-trt` | 🟡 Strong |

> Note on naming: `/templates/*` is the technical route; premium-facing copy says "Website
> Foundations," never "templates." `wellness-clinic` filter id maps to the
> `premium-wellness-clinic` slug. A `/templates → /foundations` redirect is a deferred P3 item.

### Sub-project benchmark matrix

Scores are **current best estimate**. Association is verified (just audited). The other four
are scored from structure/known state and should be **formally re-audited per the rubric**
before being called launch-ready (that audit is itself a tracked task below).

| System | Strategic | Visual | Content | Operational | Legal/Compliance | SEO | Accessibility | Avg |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Association (MHPA) | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **4.6** |
| Wellness (Lumen) | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **3.4** |
| Solo Practice (Aster) | 4.5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **3.4** |
| Med Spa | 4.5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **3.3** |
| TRT (VANTAGE) | 4.5 | 4.5 | 3.5 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **3.3** |

**Operational readiness is now scored on two tiers** (this changed how we read the demos):
- **Demo tier** — what a *clickable preview* can prove without a backend: forms that validate
  and confirm, honeypot spam protection, and **previewable logged-in experiences** (member
  dashboard + chapter-leader tools). Association now hits the demo-tier ceiling (**5**).
- **Client tier** — real authentication, persistence, payments, and AMS/CRM integration. This
  is the paid build line and remains intentionally **out of demo scope**.

**Cross-cutting reality for all demos:** they are intentionally **preview-only** — forms validate
and confirm but don't persist; the portal is a faux, no-login walkthrough; no real transactions.
"Legal/Compliance" here is about *demo disclaimers + scoped language*, not live data handling.
Full client-tier scores arrive only when a demo is customized into a real client build.

**New reusable capability — Portal Preview.** The Association now ships a `/portal` preview
(member dashboard + chapter-leader tools, lightly interactive, clearly badged "Preview Mode").
This is a **portfolio-wide selling asset**: the same pattern (patient portal, client portal,
member area) can be dropped into any of the other four systems. It is currently built **only**
for Association.

| System | Portal preview |
|---|---|
| Association (MHPA) | ✅ Member + Chapter Leader |
| Wellness · Solo · Med Spa · TRT | 🔴 Not built (candidate enhancement) |

### What's DONE ✅ across the portfolio
- All 5 systems are multi-page, live, and linked from the parent site
- Each has a Foundation detail page with at-a-glance, audience, features, page list, sales FAQs
- Per-Foundation accent palette so each reads as its own product
- Demo banners + fictional-content disclaimers present
- **Association**: full flagship pass complete — component consolidation (stat strips, FAQs,
  quick-facts), member-badge color normalization, shared final CTAs, meta/template-language
  cleanup, WCAG contrast fixes (`--assoc-coral-text`, footer), skip-to-content link, target sizes

### What NEEDS TO BE DONE — per system

**1. Association (MHPA) — ✅ reference standard**
- [x] Flagship polish complete (all 4 sprints)
- [x] **Functional demo forms** — contact, resource newsletter, and the advocacy "Take Action"
  composer now validate inline (required fields, email format), include a honeypot, and show an
  accessible success state whose copy doubles as a sales moment (shows how the live site routes
  to CRM/AMS/email and runs an advocacy portal). Shared `[data-demo-form]` engine in the layout.
- [x] **Portal preview shipped** — `/demos/association/portal` landing with role switcher into a
  **Member dashboard** (membership/renewal, CE progress, registered events, unlocked member-only
  resources, chapter, profile card) and **Chapter Leader tools** (lightly interactive create-event
  and post-announcement that update the list/feed live, member roster, chapter metrics). Dedicated
  app-chrome layout, "Preview Mode" banner, `noindex`. "Member Login" links now resolve here.
- [x] **Portal-tied resources** — added a member-only, downloadable **Chapter Event Planning
  Toolkit** detail page (8-file kit) surfaced in the library and both dashboards.
- [x] **Portal accessibility verified** — interactive chapter tools announce results via an
  `aria-live` status region and move focus to the newly created event/announcement; `:focus-visible`
  rings, `sr-only` utility, and a skip link are in place. Keeps the demo at the 5/5 a11y bar.
- ⏸️ Deferred to client build (not demo blockers): real authentication/persistence, transactional
  checkout (join/register/apply), payments, live AMS/CRM sync, association staff/admin role,
  sub-nav/mega-menu, online community. These define the **client tier** and stay out of demo scope.

**2. Premium Wellness Clinic (Lumen) — 🟡**
- [ ] Run the flagship rubric audit (use Association as the bar)
- [ ] Accessibility pass: contrast on tints, focus states, skip link, target sizes
- [ ] Verify no "template" leakage in demo-visible copy; meta description voice check
- [ ] Confirm shared CTA/heading consistency + member/badge color normalization

**3. Solo Practice (Aster) — 🟡**
- [ ] Flagship rubric audit
- [ ] Accessibility pass (skip link, contrast, targets)
- [ ] Patient-portal placeholder polish; meta/voice check
- [ ] Resources articles depth check (organic-search credibility)

**4. Med Spa — 🟡**
- [ ] Flagship rubric audit
- [ ] Give it a stronger brand identity (only system without a named brand)
- [ ] Accessibility pass; before/after gallery disclaimer & compliance language review
- [ ] Meta/voice + CTA consistency check

**5. Men's Health / TRT (VANTAGE) — 🟡**
- [ ] Flagship rubric audit (multiple prior polish passes done — see `vantage-*.md`)
- [ ] Accessibility pass on the red/black high-contrast theme (verify ratios formally)
- [ ] Content depth: smallest page count — assess if more service/proof pages are warranted
- [ ] Compliance language review (TRT/ED claims are sensitive)

## Part 3 — Recommended Direction (Next Sprints)

Prioritized so each sprint produces a recognizable milestone.

**Sprint A — Master launch blockers (highest leverage).**
Wire the audit form → GHL/email + confirmation redirect, add robots.txt + sitemap, fix
production canonicals, ship `/privacy` + `/terms` + footer links + scoped compliance language.
*Outcome: the site can legally and operationally accept a lead. Moves readiness ~58% → ~80%.*

**Sprint B — Master launch-critical.**
GA4 + Vercel analytics with conversion event, OG images + Twitter cards + favicon.ico, custom
404, form spam protection, verify chatbot key on Vercel, alt-text audit.
*Outcome: measurable, shareable, spam-resistant. ~80% → ~90%+.*

**Sprint C — Propagate the Association standard to the other four demos.**
One focused flagship-rubric pass per system (Wellness → Solo → Med Spa → VANTAGE): accessibility,
meta/voice, CTA/badge consistency. Reuse the Association sprint structure.
*Outcome: portfolio average rises from ~3.4 toward ~4.3; demos become uniformly client-ready proof.*

**Sprint D — Proof & growth (post-launch).**
About page, Foundation-vs-Custom comparison, pricing visibility, 2–3 resource articles,
case-study + testimonial structure, then evaluate Sanity for content volume.

**Sprint E (optional upsell) — Propagate the Portal Preview pattern.**
Bring a faux, no-login portal preview to one or two more systems where it sells hardest:
a **patient portal** for Solo Practice and a **client/member portal** for Wellness. Reuse the
Association `AssociationPortalLayout` pattern (app chrome + role switcher + "Preview Mode").
*Outcome: every demo can show the logged-in product, not just the marketing site — a strong
differentiator in sales conversations.*
